# Code KY Project
 This is meant to be a fictitious company website for Dunder Mifflin, the fake company from the show The Office.
 Most basic coroporate websites have this basic build with some pages/info on their location and staff and I tried to make it look as authentic as I could.
 I did a UDEMY course a few months ago and used some of the skills I learned there and code I had built and incorporated into the site where it would work.
 For 2 of my features I combined them into one, I did a CSS menu with a button that can hide or show the menu when in phone view which
 hit the other feature I chose of creating a hide/show div. The other feature I chose was the transition animiation on the locations 
 as well as a few of the buttons. I had trouble with the left over space on some of the images on the campus div and tried to fix it
 the best I could but there is still some white space at the bottom during the transition. It is pretty basic but it is functional.
